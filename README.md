## ðŸ§­ Project Overview

This project focuses on **radiomics-based medical image analysis** to build and structure a robust dataset of radiomic features for supervised classification problems.

By extracting **quantitative imaging biomarkers**â€”such as intensity, texture, shape, and spatial descriptorsâ€”this project aims to convert qualitative medical images into structured, high-dimensional information for use in **machine learning** models capable of identifying and classifying pathological patterns.
