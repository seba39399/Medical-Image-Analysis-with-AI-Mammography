# Medical-Image-Analysis-with-AI-Mammography
This is a radiomics-based project focused on extracting quantitative imaging biomarkers from mammography scans to support supervised classification tasks. It standardizes image preprocessing, feature extraction (intensity, texture, shape), and integrates clinical labels to enable the development of machine learning models for diagnostic support.
